"i would be suffering from success, if i was successful."

I'm PieBoi, you can call me Pie, I'm a Software Developer, Mechanic, Designer, Illustrator and Animator.   
I'm not good at math, or at reading, or at literally anything,
I might be slowly losing my sanity but that's ok! 

I am a caffiene and melatonin addict.
